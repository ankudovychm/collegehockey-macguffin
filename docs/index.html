        <p class="subtitle">All updated at 12AM EST daily</p>

<p><strong>The MacGuffin is a symbolic championship belt that moves continuously among college hockey teams.</strong>
    <br><br>
This website uses data from CHN to track the evolving ownership of this championship belt amongst all NCAA D1 teams, starting with the first
    college hockey game ever played, and updated every night at midnight for most recent game results.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, you can go back into history, viewing every time the belt, and its inverse, change hands, as well as a leaderboard to see the
    longest consecutive and total time a school has held the record.

    Finally, you are also able to view these belts on a conference level, where only tilts between schools in each conference are counted
    in the belt race.
        <br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Only games between current NCAA D1 schools are counted.</li>
    <li>This restriction means some historical results may appear differently from other sources.</li>
    <li>Specifically:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Only results involving teams currently in Division 1 are included.</strong></li>
            <li>Games involving teams that were previously in Division 1 but no longer are today are <strong>not included</strong>.</li>
            <li>Games involving teams currently in Division 1, regardless of their status at the time of the game, are <strong>included</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    Despite these limitations, this still gives a good view into the college hockey championship belt.
