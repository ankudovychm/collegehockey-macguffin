# The CollegeHockey-macguffin

The MacGuffin is the championship belt of college hockey.

Itâ€™s a symbolic title passed from one team to another, starting with the first college hockey team to win a game. Since then, every team that defeats the current MacGuffin holder claims the title, creating an unbroken chain of victories spanning over a century.

This site tracks the holder of the College Hockey MacGuffin amongst games between current NCAA D1 teams from 1900 to the present.

Histroic data from 2023 has already been pulled and is saved as to not pull and process the data every day. At 12 AM every night, the results of the current season are updated by pulling data from CHN with a Github action, updating the league-wide, conference wide reverse and regular macguffins. Additionally, it updates any 'for {xyz} days' statements, and their associated leaderboards. 

Images for each team and conferences were pulled from the atheltics website of the respective school where availible.
